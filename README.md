Introducing Glitchr, an incubator for the world’s greatest crypto projects.
Glitchr is an incubator for the world’s greatest projects. We have launched possibly the most complete platform in crypto consisting of an NFT marketplace,governance, customizable NFTs, insane APY yield farming and upcoming features like eSports betting and an Android wallet for storing your DIE and RETRY. Our platform is powered by Ethereum, which gives it versatility and speed and helps us stand out.

Passive income for holders
Our platform allows users to passively earn crypto by simply holding their tokens in our special smart contracts. This system rewards our long term investors by allowing them to passively earn RETRY, which can then be used for other features.

Changing the eSports game
We noticed a vacuum in the eSports community. There was no crypto project that catered to them at all. So we built a platform where eSports fans can bet on their favourite teams and would eventually be able to pay for passes for their favourite games. Players can also set up virtual PvP games against each other and place bets, all on our platform. This implementation is a first of its kind, and we have strived to do it right. For us, first time’s the charm.

Simplified NFTs.
We’ve made NFTs as simple as possible. Users simply have to send an image to our platform and watch it come out as an NFT. On top of that, the creator gets to keep 50% of the cost of the NFT, while we burn 30%. Users can also sell their NFTs to other ecosystem users on our P2P NFT marketplace. It’s NFTs, but you don’t even have to think about it.

Why Glitchr?
Glitchr is everything good about crypto in one. Crypto isn’t simple enough for everyone, so we decided to change that. With Glitchr, it’s simpler to use all of what crypto has to offer, while feeling safe and knowing we’ve got your back. We take everything into consideration, so that your crypto experience is the best one there can be.
